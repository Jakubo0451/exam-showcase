            In my first obligatory assignment in Advanced CSS course, I was
            tasked with recreating an already existing website from provided
            screenshots. We have been provided with two screenshots that we were
            supposed to recreate. The provided screenshots of the website in
            question were from FINN.no homepage and FINN.no log-in page. Each
            group member was supposed to choose one of the screenshots and
            worked on implementing it individually. We were working on different
            branches in a GitHub repository and when we were finished, we have
            merged both branches.

          <h3>Learning outcomes and Application</h3>
          <p>
            Through the completion of this assignment I have learned a couple of
            things. This task required me to use BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)
            methodology for the naming convention. I needed to use it in order
            to properly name containers holding the content and call those names
            in CSS for styling. I have learned how to correctly implement this
            naming convention and I am able to use it for any of my future
            projects. In order to be most effective with it, I have started with
            naming containers using this methodology and adhering to the best
            practices right away. I had a feeling that this code might be quite
            extensive, and I had no intention on going back to rename all of the
            created containers. Another thing the project has tasked me with was
            using SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), this syntax writing
            method allows for some additional features to be used in normal CSS.
            As a growing developer I have learned how to properly utilize this
            syntax and its features such as nesting and variables. The purpose
            of this assignment that I have yet to mention was to implement
            existing design systems. FINN.no has a design system called “Fabric
            Design”, in my implementation all of the style elements that I have
            included were taken from that specific design system. That obviously
            includes colors, fonts, sizes of said fonts etc. but also when to
            use it and for what purpose. Through doing so I have learned how to
            read through such a design system and implement its components.
            Through the whole assignment I have used GitHub extensively, this is
            yet another thing I have learned during the completion of this task.
            I have learned how to effectively use GitHub through Visual Studio
            Code, commit changes, how to properly name my commit messages,
            create new branches, merge said branches, resolve merging issues,
            generally work in a collaborative way, and deploy a live website
            using GitHub pages.
          </p>
          <h3>Start over?</h3>
          <p>
            If I could start over, I would definitely use more responsive values
            such as % and view-width instead of pixels. Another thing that I
            would like to do differently is to pay more attention to layout and
            containers. The code has become a bit of a mess, and it could be
            hard to maintain for anyone that isn’t me, so I want to especially
            fix this part of the project.
          </p>
          <h3>Advantages & Disadvantages</h3>
          <p>
            I would like to talk about advantages of implemented methods first.
            The BEM methodology allows for distinct and distinguishable names
            for all of the elements, this makes it quite easy to target them
            through CSS code. It could potentially make it easier for other
            developers to work with your code. The disadvantage that I
            personally experienced was that BEM can potentially become very
            cluttered and messy. When every single container and element has a
            class potentially spanning multiple words, it can be an eyesore to
            look at. Finding something a specific container or remembering how
            you’ve named it becomes a problem. As a developer I appreciate the
            design systems for providing me with clear guidelines on how I
            should design a website. By following a design system, I can think
            much less about what exact sizes and colors the website needs to
            have since I have everything handed on a silver platter. The main
            disadvantage comes from the fact that the design system must be
            thoughtfully created to be good. It needs to be accessible by
            everyone, all the colors need to have correct contrasts, the font
            sizes need to be readable, etc. If the design system does not meet
            those criteria, you will be posed a question if you want to strictly
            follow it and potentially make the website less accessible or simply
            follow it less and risk less coherent design.
