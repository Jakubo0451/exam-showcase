            In this obligatory group task we were supposed to implement a poster
            design through HTML and CSS. This was a group task, and I was paired
            with Ophe Namata-Nielsen, we were working exclusively through a
            GitHub repository, through commits and merges. The assignment
            required us to implement a given poster design in a webpage, to that
            we had to select certain elements of the poster and animate them
            using different techniques. When we were done last thing, we had to
            do was to orally present the project on campus.
          </p>
          <h3>Learning outcomes and application</h3>
          <p>
            We had access to the PDF file of the poster itself, so we could open
            it through Adobe Illustrator. Through it we cleaned up the file and
            bundled together elements that we felt like were not suited for
            animation, that was our background. Next up we decided to export all
            the files that we wanted to animate as SVGs, since the that was also
            part of the requirements. We as a group have learned a lot. We have
            learned how to lower the carbon footprint of websites by how to use
            and create SVGs. By animating select elements we practiced and got
            better at different types of animations and CSS drawing. Thing that
            has taken a lot of time alongside the animation part was
            implementing the poster itself. It had to be responsive and preserve
            aspect ratio. We have gotten a lot better at ensuring responsiveness
            in any sort of web projects which I value greatly. This project
            brought more creative side in both of us, encouraging any sort of
            innovation and creativity is an aspect I appreciate in school
            projects. Continuing on from the technical side we were also tasked
            with using SASS. We implemented it together with BEM, which I
            believe was not a requirement, but we have used it anyway in order
            to practice. Both of our BEM and SASS skills have improved upon
            completion of this assignment. Last thing that was new for us was
            oral presentation on campus. It was quite nice to practice it since
            we did not have that sort of thing this semester.
          </p>
          <h3>Start Over?</h3>
          <p>
            If I could start over, I would implement more different types of
            animations to the design itself. Despite our great effort we did not
            get all of the animations to work in our design and we had to drop
            them. Now that I know how to ensure responsiveness much better, I
            would probably spend less time on layout and practicing animation
            skills instead.
          </p>
          <h3>Advantages & Disadvantages</h3>
          <p>
            The whole advantage of implementing those animations is that we can
            engage the user in a much greater manner than before. Main
            disadvantage is that a lot of these methods are unnecessarily
            complicated to use, for example SMIL path, and are kind of useless
            and are becoming deprecated. Outside of this course I donâ€™t think I
            will ever be using SMIL or CSS drawings for anything, I can do the
            same with simple CSS animations or GSAP instead.

          <h4>Main Contributions</h4>
          <p>
            In this obligatory assignment, I have contributed a lot and I would
            like to talk about that. First of all I have created the layout, I
            exported all of the elements as SVGs and then placed them correctly
            on the page, all of the texts in right fonts, the footer and the qr
            code. I tried my best to get all of the elements as close to the
            original placement as possible. After doing that I animated the
            children jumping up and down with CSS animations.
          </p>
          <h4>Main Changes</h4>
          <p>
            The main changes I have introduced were some more animation types
            that we did not have in the original assignement. First I have
            animated the moon to rotate using SMIL transform. In order to do
            that I had to place it as code inside the html and apply the
            animation inside said SVG code. I have done it because the upper
            section of the poster couldve used a little more movement. Compared
            to the middle section there was not a lot of things going and I
            wanted to balance it out. The next change I introduced was an
            another animation, using a method we have not used in our original
            assignemnt, that is SMIL transform. I have done the same as with the
            moon, I extraced the SVG code and placed it inside html. After that
            I applied the transform animation inside said SVG code. What the
            animation does is basically it fades in and out the element, it is
            roughly synced up with other animations, giving the entire poster a
            nice sense of integrity. I have introduced this change to
            demonstrate my ability to work with SMIL transform and give more
            life to the poster itself. Last thing I have done was to introduce
            "prefers reduced motion" media query. I have done it increase
            accessibility so the people with motion sickness can enjoy the
            design of the poster without worrying about getting sick. The media
            query itself simply turns of all CSS animations on the poster.
          </p>
          <h4>Accessibility</h4>
          <p>
            One of the main things regarding the accessibility in this project
            is that it is responsive. All of the values are dynamic, using
            either view width or percentages. Making the webpage accessible not
            only to the desktop users but to phone users or tablet users as
            well. Another thing is that the poster itself uses good design
            princples, all of the texts have good contrasts with their
            backgrounds and are readable. This makes the text accessible for
            people with color blindness. I have introduced media query "prefers
            reduced motion", this makes the CSS animations stop for people who
            wish it to be so. This makes the page more accessible for people
            with motion sickness. I have not found any resources on how to
            implement reduced motion to SMIL animations therefore it is only
            implemented to the CSS animations.
          </p>
          <h4>Sustainability</h4>
          <p>
            One of the reasons this page is sustainable is that it uses SVGs for
            all of the images. This makes all of the images weigh a lot less
            than if they were implemented as JPEGs or PNGs. Another thing is
            that this website has no filler files, everything in the asset
            folder is used. So there is no unnecessary data consumption
