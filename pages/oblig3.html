          The third and last and biggest task was also a group assignment that
          we’ve worked on exclusively through GitHub. My two group members were:
          Modesta Trakselyte and Marius Sandvik Bjørnstad. We were tasked with
          creating a scrolly-telling website tackling a specific subject of a
          chosen Sustained Development Goal. The subject in question was also
          chosen by us, but it could not be too broad and had to be presented as
          a story. This task had a quite a bunch of technical requirements that
          I will delve deeper into in the next section. After delivery we also
          had to present the project orally on campus.
        </p>
        <h3>Learning outcomes and application</h3>
        <p>
          As the biggest and most demanding obligatory assignment with quite a
          bit of technical requirements it was the one of the greatest learning
          opportunities for me as a developer. As I’ve mentioned in the previous
          section this project required us to create a scrolly-telling website,
          with that we have started on research, storyboarding and creation of
          necessary illustrations. Through the beginning section of this
          project, I became better at storyboarding since we three decided that
          all of us will take one development goal, find some topic, and create
          a storyboard with it. My initial idea was “charismatic species bias”,
          but ultimately, we have chosen SDG 12 and with it the story of a fish
          caught in Norway and sent to be packaged in China. With our subject
          chosen we begun to create the illustrations and code. I had gotten to
          practice a lot of Adobe Illustrator, I was already pretty good at it,
          but it was nice to shake off the rust. At that point I had also begun
          to play around with intersection observers API for JavaScript so that
          we could implement it the moment we had all of the animations. I have
          never worked with it before, so it took a long time of reading
          documentation and looking through examples of code in order to fully
          understand how it works. In the end I got comfortable working with it.
          Through working on this project, I got the chance to work with the
          scrolly-telling techniques, as someone who has never done that before
          it was a great learning experience. We had gotten a chance to learn
          how to properly tell a story and convey a message effectively. I have
          gotten a further chance to practice CSS Animations, BEM, and SASS. All
          three were utilized by us in the project, so we could produce code
          that could be maintained by other people and is efficient by following
          the DRY principle. I have practiced another important skill in
          developer’s skillset and that is accessibility. I already knew the
          basics of accessibility from previous courses but here I had a chance
          to learn about “prefers reduced motion” and how to implement it for
          people who would need it. One of my biggest learning experiences
          during the making of this project was JavaScript implementation. I
          have worked extensively on getting the intersection observers API to
          work, through this process I read a lot of documentation and gotten
          through a lot of trail and error. I can comfortably use the API now in
          any future projects. I have also read about “ScrollTrigger” which
          would allow me to trigger animations on user scrolling, but I did not
          have enough time to finish that. Despite that I feel like if I read a
          little more documentation in the future, I could possibly implement
          it. Through the use of the API, I learned more about lazy loading and
          how to improve optimization for the end users. Graphic Design and
          general use of its principles were something I considered while making
          the illustrations, I used colors that worked with each other and took
          inspiration from palettes I found online. One last thing I would like
          to mention in this section is that the extensive collaboration using
          GitHub. I was already proficient in using GitHub at that point, but I
          did manage to practice it a little further.
        </p>
        <h3>Start Over?</h3>
        <p>
          If I could start over, I would probably focus more on the storytelling
          aspect of the project. I would like to have a bit more text explaining
          what exactly is going on. We have put a lot of focus on making the
          illustrations, but the text part of this project was quite
          minimalistic. The text also had accessibility issues, with contrast
          ratios being off and it scaling to being a bit too small, that is
          another thing I would work on more.
        </p>
        <h3>Advantages & Disadvantages</h3>
        <p>
          With making your website sustainable there is an obvious and very
          important advantage that it reduces the carbon footprint and ever so
          slightly postpones our cataclysmic demise. With that in mind, the
          steps we take in order to ensure said sustainability can impact the
          visual aesthetics, and with that comes potential impact on
          accessibility. It is important to find the right balance between those
          two. I am quite positively geared towards the entirety of JavaScript
          part of this task. Implementation of lazy loading optimizes your
          website and I have no idea what a disadvantage of it could be. The
          fact that it potentially could be difficult to implement? Maybe, but I
          feel like that could be an issue of skill. Implementing additional
          accessibility options is great, making most people be able to use your
          website is good, but with all those options there could be an
          additional file size coming with It, again its important to find
          balance between all of it.
        </p>

        <h4>Main Contributions</h4>
        <p>
          In this project my main contributions span all accross the technical
          side and the visual side. First of all, I have worked extensively in
          Adobe Illustrator to produce couple of the illustrations used in the
          project. The illustrations I have created are as follows: the box and
          the fish inside the box, three shipping containers, boxes inside the
          shipping container, the whole design of the top down ship together
          with the water waves next to it. Next I made the animations for the
          closing shipping container doors and the water waves in the top down
          view of the ship. I have worked extensively with JavaScript to get it
          to work. I have setup the intersection observers API for almost every
          single animation in the site and made sure it works. I also made sure
          the animations stop whenever the user isnt looking at them. I also
          helped with idea creating process, helped with layout and ensuring
          that the webpage is responsive. I also optimized most the SVGs by
          reducing their sizes in adobe illustrator with simplyifing path
          options.
        </p>
        <h4>Main Changes</h4>
        <p>
          The first main change to the project is the inclusion of a title in
          the top part of the webpage. I have done it so that the potential user
          has more of an idea of what the webpage is about whenever they open
          the website for the first time. Second thing that changes was the font
          for the entire website, I have changed it to "Lucida Sans". I did it
          because I felt like it fit more with the other parts of the design and
          also because I liked it more than the previous font used. Continuing
          on with the text I have changed the color to black and in section six
          I changed it to some kind of bone-white and increased the boldness of
          it in general. I have done so because I wanted the text to be more
          readable and have a bigger contrast with the backgrounds. For the same
          reason positions of some of the paragraphs has changed as well. I
          changed the font size from being just view width to using clamp. This
          allows me to increase the readability of the text on mobile devices.
          One of the main point in feedback that we have received for this
          assignement was that the webpage could use some more paragraphs
          explaining things. That is also one of the biggest changes I have
          made. I added text that explains how unsustainable the container
          shipping actually is and showing the user what can they do in order to
          pick the right product. Show what the user can do to pick right
          packages. I have done it to convey the message of the story in a
          better way and offer a solution when the user finishes the story.
        </p>
        <h4>Accessibility</h4>
        <p>
          Accessibility in this project was regarded with utmost importance.
          First of all the entire webpage is responsive, meaning that there is
          no horizontal scrolling at any point and all of the content can be
          accessed on any device. All of the text has good contrast with the
          backgrounds and passes the WCAG tests, so it can be accessed by people
          with vision impairment. For pople using a screen reader there are also
          text alternatives for images. We are using prefers reduced motion
          media query so that people with motion sickness and those who prefer
          less movmenet on screen can enjoy the story as well.
        </p>
        <h4>Sustainability</h4>
        <p>
          To ensure sustainability we are using SVGs to display our images,
          because it offers smaller image size with better quality. All of those
          SVGs have been optimized using Adobe Illustrator, by simplyfing their
          paths and sometimes using pathfinder to merge elements together.
          Another thing is that this website has no filler files, everything in
          the asset folder is used. So there is no unnecessary data consumption.
